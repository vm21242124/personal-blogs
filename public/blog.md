# Introduction to MDX

MDX allows you to write JSX directly in your Markdown documents. It combines the best of both worlds: Markdown for writing content and React for adding interactive components.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a format that lets you write JSX embedded inside Markdown documents. With MDX, you can import and use React components alongside your Markdown content.

### Benefits of Using MDX

1. **Flexibility**: Use React components in Markdown files.
2. **Interactivity**: Add interactive elements to your content.
3. **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent style with React components.

  MDX is especially useful for creating documentation sites, blogs, and any content-driven application where you want to leverage the power of React components.

## Getting Started

To get started with MDX, follow these steps:

1. **Install MDX**: Use `@mdx-js/rollup` and `@mdx-js/react` with your build tool.
2. **Create MDX Files**: Write your content in `.mdx` files.
3. **Import MDX Files**: Import and render MDX content in your React components.

For a detailed guide, refer to the [MDX documentation](https://mdxjs.com/).
